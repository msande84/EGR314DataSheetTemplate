## ESP32

* Easier to program than PIC
* Low power
* High functionality
* Higher clock speed will be able to handle communication between all other subsystems

**Subsystem Description**
My subsystem is the wireless control subsystem. The ESP32 was chosen due to the in-built Wi-Fi chip. My susbsystem will also need to coordinate communication between the external human interface and the other subsystems.
